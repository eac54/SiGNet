# SiGNet
Code for the SiGNet Cytoscape App

SiGNet is a tool for simulating biological data for a signalling network of known structure. This data can then be used for benchmarking of inference strategies by performing inference on the simulated data and scoring the predictions against the gold standard, known network structure.

This repository contains the source code for the app.
